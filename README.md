Hello,
  You can call me Scarecrow. This message marks the beginning of my journey into the vast world of computer technologies.
  I am currently learning (re-learning) a few cybersecurity skills and finding safe ways to practice them.
  Specifically, I am interested in Penetraton Testing and all of the things that fall under this career path.

  Outside of cybersecurity I engage in a array of different hobbies. I like playing videogames, practicing various art forms, walking/hiking, and cooking.
  I occasionally read.
